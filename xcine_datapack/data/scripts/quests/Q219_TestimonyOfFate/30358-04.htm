You have become enlightened to the principles of abyss, I congratulate you! You have witnessed the <font color="LEVEL">dark fate that our race will bear</font> in the upcoming Chaotic Chronicle. No need for disappointment or sorrow. We must only carry out our duty.<br>
Now take this <font color="LEVEL">Mark of Fate</font>. It is essential for advancing to a higher rank. In addition, I'll give you the <font color="LEVEL">Dimension Diamond</font>! The Dimension Diamond can be exchanged with special objects from the Gatekeeper of a town. I expect you shall be even more skillful the next time we meet. May the grace of Shilen be upon you.
