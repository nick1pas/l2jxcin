I will give you the Red Fairy Dust if you bring <font color="LEVEL">10 skulls</font> each from the <font color="LEVEL">Grandis, Karul Bugbear, Breka Orc Overlord, and the Leto Lizardman Overlord</font>! Didn't you hear me swear on the jewel? Pixies always keep their promises! Would you like me to tell you once more where you can find them?!<br>
Grandis can be found in Death Pass.<br>
Karul Bugbears can be found in Hunters Valley.<br>
Breka Orc Overlords are located in Breka's Stronghold.<br>
And, Leto Lizardman Overlords are usually found on the Plains of the Lizardmen.
