This mission is to drive out the remnants of the Grecian military force that is currently encamped in the northwestern part of the Horseshoe Valley. Dont take them too lightly by thinking that they are mere rabble of defeated soldiers. Your opponents are ol mahums of the Bloody Axe army led by the Blood Lord Nurka. They are a formidable enemy that you shouldnt take too lightly.<br>
