Mercenary Red Foot:<br>
I will give you the information that a clan leader, who wants to grow the power of his clan would be interested in obtaining. In each area, there are aristocrats who give support to small clans. These aristocrats would include Sir Kristof Rodemai in Giran Castle Town and Sir Gustaf Athebaldt of Oren Castle Town. Of course they are not just philanthropists. I would say they would want something in return for their support of a clan, wouldnt you agree?<br>
