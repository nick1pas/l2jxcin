Mercenary Red Foot:<br>
Have you heard about the rumor? Antharas, the earthdragon who had been sleeping in Dragon Valley has awoken. This is terrible news. If it comes out of the Lair of Antharas and runs amok, all of Giran region will fall into a state of pandemonium in no time.<br> However, there is someone who is recruiting people to form a militia force to catch Antharas. It is a woman named Gabrielle in Giran Castle Town. However, does she really think that they will have any chance against the dragon. Unfortunately, I think it is way beyond their power!<br>
