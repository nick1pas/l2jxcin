All right, lets go ahead and open this box. Opening a padlock like this one is a piece of cake. Here we go! There that was too easy. Now, lets see whats in the box.<br>
Hmm? Machine parts? This Guild Mark seems to be that of the Black Anvil Guild what do you think? Although I dont know for sure, these seem to be parts that are used by dwarves to do repair work on golems. If you take them to a store, I think you will be able to sell them at a pretty reasonable price.<br>
