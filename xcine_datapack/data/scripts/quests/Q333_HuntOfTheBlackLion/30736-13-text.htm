Mercenary Red Foot:<br>
Have you heard of the Aden Business Guild? It is an association of human traders. Since they saw that dwarven traders and warehouse keepers were generating a lot of profit while engaging in their organizational activities, humans decided to imitate them by forming a guild of their own. However, it seems to me that the business savvy of a dwarf is inborn  No matter how hard humans try, I dont think they can keep up with dwarves.<br>
On top of that, adding insult to injury, evil spirits frequently attack the guilds cargo wagons and steal their valuable goods making the humans suffer great losses.<br>
