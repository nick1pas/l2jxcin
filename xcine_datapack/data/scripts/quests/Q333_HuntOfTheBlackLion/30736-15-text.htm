Have you ever heard of a hatchling? It is a cute baby dragon that has been hatched from the egg of a wyrm or a drake. Among pet handlers, I heard that there is someone who knows how to raise a hatchling as ones own pet. I think his name is Cooper or something like that. If you are interested in keeping a hatchling as a pet, why dont you go see him!<br>
