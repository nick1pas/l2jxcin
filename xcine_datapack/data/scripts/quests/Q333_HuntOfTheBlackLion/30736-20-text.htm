Mercenary Red Foot:<br>
Hey brother! Did you tell me that youre currently on active duty? I know that must be hard work! Is there anything I can help you with?<br>What kind of box is that? Oh, I know. Thats a cargo box used by traders. Since you brought it to me  I can assume that you dont have any intention of returning it to the merchant, am I right? All right. I'll open the box for you. Of course, you can have the contents of the box. Instead, Ill charge you a small fee. I think <font color="LEVEL">650 adena</font> will be appropriate. Think of it as the price for opening the box and for keeping my mouth shut.<br>
