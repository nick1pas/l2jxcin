/**
 * This class merely enumerates the three necessary states for all quests:
 * CREATED: a quest state is created but the quest is not yet accepted.
 * STARTED: the player has accepted the quest.  Quest is currently in progress
 * COMPLETED: the quest has been completed.
 * 
 * In addition, this class defines two functions for lookup and inverse lookup
 * of the state given a name.  This is useful only for saving the state values
 * into the database with a more readable form and then being able to read the
 * string back and remap them to their correct states.
 * 
 * All quests have these and only these states.
